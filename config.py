APP_HOW_IT_WORKS = """
 This is an **AI-Tutored Rubric exercise** that acts as a tutor guiding a student through a shared asset, like an article. It uses the OpenAI Assistants API with GPT-4. The **questions and rubric** are defined by a **faculty**. The **feedback and the score** are generarated by the **AI**. 

It can:

1. provide feedback on a student's answers to questions about an asset
2. roughly "score" a student to determine if they can move on to the next section.  

Scoring is based on a faculty-defined rubric on the backend. These rubrics can be simple (i.e. "full points if the student gives a thoughtful answer") or specific with different criteria and point thresholds. The faculty also defines a minimum pass threshold for each question. The threshold could be as low as zero points to pass any answer, or it could be higher. 

Using AI to provide feedback and score like this is a very experimental process. Some things to note: 

 - AIs make mistakes. Users are encourage to skip a question if the AI is not understanding them or giving good feedback. 
 - The AI might say things that it can't do, like "Ask me anything about the article". I presume further refinement can reduce these kinds of responses. 
 - Scoring is highly experimental. At this point, it should mainly be used to gauge if a user gave an approximately close answer to what the rubric suggests. It is not recommended to show the user the numeric score. 
 - Initial testing indicates that the AI is a very easy grader. This is probably good in this experiment, and it may be refined with different prompting.

For video producers: There might be a shift towards more personal, less polished production styles that emphasize the instructor's presence. This could include more use of tablet drawing techniques and interspersing talking head shots with informational slides.\n\n3. For platform designers: Learning management systems and video hosting platforms might incorporate features that encourage shorter video segments and provide analytics on student engagement based on video characteristics.\n\n4. For students: Learners might benefit from more engaging content, potentially leading to improved learning outcomes and course completion rates.\n\n5. For institutions: Universities and other education providers might need to invest in training for educators on effective online video production techniques, rather than simply repurposing existing lecture recordings.\n\nOverall, these findings could lead to a more standardized approach to creating engaging online educational content, potentially revolutionizing the way online courses are designed and delivered."
