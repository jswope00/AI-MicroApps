"""

APP_HOW_IT_WORKS = """
 Using this app, a student submits a response. The student's response is compared to the key points that the instructor is looking for in the response, and the AI provides feedback on where the student met or fell short of expectations. 
 The AI may also score a student based on rubrics created by the instructor. AI generally performs better when grading discrete, tangible items (i.e. The student included a personal experience) whereas it is less consistent with judgement calls (e.g. The student's response is high quality).

You might expect that animated app_images are better than static app_images, but the research does not conclusively indicate that. Animated app_images could be more distracting and therefore less effective than static app_images. The exception is when demonstrating complex manual processes, where animations have shown to be effective. In my own work, I expect that I might try to use app_images that support the audio instead of purely decorative app_images or 'talking head' format.
