APP_HOW_IT_WORKS = """
 This is an **AI-Tutored Rubric exercise** that acts as a tutor guiding a student through a shared asset, like an article. It uses the OpenAI Assistants API with GPT-4. The **questions and rubric** are defined by a **faculty**. The **feedback and the score** are generarated by the **AI**. 

It can:

1. provide feedback on a student's answers to questions about an asset
2. roughly "score" a student to determine if they can move on to the next section.  

Scoring is based on a faculty-defined rubric on the backend. These rubrics can be simple (i.e. "full points if the student gives a thoughtful answer") or specific with different criteria and point thresholds. The faculty also defines a minimum pass threshold for each question. The threshold could be as low as zero points to pass any answer, or it could be higher. 

Using AI to provide feedback and score like this is a very experimental process. Some things to note: 

 - AIs make mistakes. Users are encourage to skip a question if the AI is not understanding them or giving good feedback. 
 - The AI might say things that it can't do, like "Ask me anything about the article". I presume further refinement can reduce these kinds of responses. 
 - Scoring is highly experimental. At this point, it should mainly be used to gauge if a user gave an approximately close answer to what the rubric suggests. It is not recommended to show the user the numeric score.

# Ebola Virus Ecology and Transmission
Ebola is a zoonotic disease. Zoonotic diseases can be passed between animals and humans. 

## Animal-to-Animal Transmission
Evidence suggests that bats are the reservoir hosts for Ebola virus. Bats carrying the virus can transmit it to other animals, like apes, monkeys, and duikers (antelopes), as well as to humans. 

## Spillover Event
A "Spillover Event" occurs when an animal (bat, ape, monkey, duiker) or human becomes infected with Ebola virus through contact with the reservoir host. This contact could occur through hunting or preparing the animal's meat for eating. 

## Human-to-Human Transmission
Once the Ebola virus has infected the first human, transmission of the virus from one human to another can occur through contact with the blood and body fluids of sick people or with the bodies of those who have died of Ebola. 

## Survivor
Ebola survivors face new challenges after recovery. Some survivors report effects such as tiredness and muscle aches and can face stigma as they re-enter their communities. """
