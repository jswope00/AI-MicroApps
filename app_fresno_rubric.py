APP_INTRO = """This is an application that applies the Fresno test (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC143529/pdf/319.pdf) for competence in evidence based medicine, and provides feedback via AI using the same rubric as the Fresno test. It is an experimental app to determine the correlation between AI scoring and human scoring for a validated accurate and effective rubric. 
"""

APP_HOW_IT_WORKS = """
 This is an **AI-Tutored Rubric exercise** that acts as a tutor guiding a student through a shared asset, like an article. It uses the OpenAI Assistants API with GPT-4. The **questions and rubric** are defined by a **faculty**. The **feedback and the score** are generarated by the **AI**. 

It can:

1. provide feedback on a student's answers to questions about an asset
2. roughly "score" a student to determine if they can move on to the next section.  

Scoring is based on a faculty-defined rubric on the backend. These rubrics can be simple (i.e. "full points if the student gives a thoughtful answer") or specific with different criteria and point thresholds. The faculty also defines a minimum pass threshold for each question. The threshold could be as low as zero points to pass any answer, or it could be higher. 

Using AI to provide feedback and score like this is a very experimental process. Some things to note: 

 - AIs make mistakes. Users are encourage to skip a question if the AI is not understanding them or giving good feedback. 
 - The AI might say things that it can't do, like "Ask me anything about the article". I presume further refinement can reduce these kinds of responses. 
 - Scoring is highly experimental. At this point, it should mainly be used to gauge if a user gave an approximately close answer to what the rubric suggests. It is not recommended to show the user the numeric score. 
 - Initial testing indicates that the AI is a very easy grader. This is probably good in this experiment, and it may be refined with different prompting.
