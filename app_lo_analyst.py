This app uses AI to analyze a single or a set of learning objectives and return feedback on how to improve the objective. Specifically, this app measures how SMART (Specific, Measureable, Actionable, Realistic, Time-Bound) the objectives are.

            Good learning objectives avoid avoid vague terms like ‚Äúunderstand,‚Äù ‚Äúlearn,‚Äù or ‚Äúknow‚Äù because there is no metric for whether learning has occurred or not. Instead, they should use actionable verbs, like those from Bloom's Taxonomy.
            Here are some good, SMART learning objectives:
            - By the end of this unit, students will be able to describe three causes of World War II.
            - By the end of this module, employees will be able to locate the fire escape on each floor.

            Here are some poor ones:
            - By the end of this lesson, students will understand why World War II started (this objective is not specific or measureable)
            - Employees will know what to do in case of fire. (This is not time-bound, measureable, or specific. It may not be achievable if there is a larger scope of what to do in case of fire than can be covered in the lesson.)

            Finally, provide a suggestion on how to rewrite the objective so that it is SMART and includes a verb from Bloom's taxonomy.
