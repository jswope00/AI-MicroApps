This app creates alt text for accessibility from app_images. 
                For most app_images, it provides brief alt text to describe the image, focusing on the most important information first. 

                For complex app_images, like charts and graphs, the app creates a short description of the image and a longer detail that describes what the complex image is conveying. 

                For more information, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/" target="_blank">W3C Images Accessibility Guidelines</a>
