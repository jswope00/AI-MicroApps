# " narrative feedback frequently does not providethe level of specificity to reinforce strong performance and correctmistakes, leaving students dissatisfied with the feedback received."
# " Our approach wasgrounded in feedback principles linked to the deliberate practiceframework with educational interventions designed to change behav-iours based on the social cognitive theory""
# """Good feedback includes the following: """"
# - Positive Feedback that is specific
# - Constructive Feedback that is specific
# - Improvement Plan that is specific and actionable. 

# This article: Improving the quality of written feedback using written feedback (https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/103779/3/ImprovingQualityWrittenFeedback.pdf)
# - EPs should contain clear descriptions of what students did well and clear statements of the areas for improvement, 
# - Statements should be linked to observed behaviours at the level of the **task** rather than the self
# - Both (what students did well and areas for improvement) should be anchored in specific consultations to aid recall and emphasise the relevance of the feedback to real clinical practice; building ‘logical connections’ for students
# - The numbers of identified strengths and areas for improvement should be limited and prioritised so that students can focus their efforts to improve in the most important areas identified in the verbal discussion;

APP_HOW_IT_WORKS = """
 This is an **AI-Powered Feedback Generator ** that writes narrative feedback for a simulated patient scenario based on a numeric rubric. It is prompted to provide positive and constructive feedback that is specific. And to provide improvement plans that are specific and actionable.
 Sample text is fed to the AI, so the chance of hallucination is less likely. Conversely, the AI only has general statements and numeric inputs so it does not have the data to point to specific, observeable behaviors from the student's interaction. 
threshold for each question. The threshold could be as low as zero points to pass any answer, or it could be higher. 

Using AI to provide feedback and score like this is a very experimental process. Some things to note: 

 - AIs make mistakes. Users are encourage to skip a question if the AI is not understanding them or giving good feedback. 
 - The AI might say things that it can't do, like "Ask me anything about the article". I presume further refinement can reduce these kinds of responses. 
 - Scoring is highly experimental. At this point, it should mainly be used to gauge if a user gave an approximately close answer to what the rubric suggests. It is not recommended to show the user the numeric score. 
 - Initial testing indicates that the AI is a very easy grader. This is probably good in this experiment, and it may be refined with different prompting.
