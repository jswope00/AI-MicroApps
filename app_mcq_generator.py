APP_HOW_IT_WORKS = """
 This is an **MCQ Generator** that can create multiple choice questions in different formats and for different subject domains depending on the user's input.

Using AI to provide feedback and score like this is a very experimental process. Some things to note: 

 - AIs make mistakes. Users are encourage to skip a question if the AI is not understanding them or giving good feedback. 
 - The AI might say things that it can't do, like "Ask me anything about the article". I presume further refinement can reduce these kinds of responses. 
 - Scoring is highly experimental. At this point, it should mainly be used to gauge if a user gave an approximately close answer to what the rubric suggests. It is not recommended to show the user the numeric score. 
 - Initial testing indicates that the AI is a very easy grader. This is probably good in this experiment, and it may be refined with different prompting.
